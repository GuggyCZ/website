After half year of prepairing and sourcing necessary parts I've started to design hardware clone of [Uzebox](http://belogic.com/uzebox/) game platform.

The layout can be fitted in one of the plastic boxes I have at home. The parts are sourced mostly from what I found in my drawers. Also the design is single sided because I wanted to create this by toner transfer method at home. There are only 4 jumpers.

I do not have the schematic or manufacturing data anymore, so here's just a picture of PCB in Altium Designer.
