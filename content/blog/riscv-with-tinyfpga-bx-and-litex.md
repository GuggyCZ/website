I have tinyFPGA BX dev board which I used to test open-source [YOSYS](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys) and [IceStorm](https://hackaday.com/2018/10/03/icestorm-tools-roundup/) tools. I also liked an awesome gui [IceStudio](https://icestudio.io/) that is multi-platform and installed everything to your system thanks to [APIO](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio) package/tools manager.

I also sucesfully tried to create RISC-V system with [picosoc](https://github.com/tinyfpga/TinyFPGA-BX/tree/master/examples/picosoc) example.

After a year or so, I wanted to test LiteX project again. Last time I had some issues to get it working. This time I suceeded. This blogpost is more like backup of what I did in case I would like to get Litex working again.

**Note:** You can find other photos/video and info also in my tweets [here](https://twitter.com/hubmartin/status/1470521224669413376) and [there](https://twitter.com/hubmartin/status/1470541164977831943).

# LiteX installation

LiteX needs some other tools for TinyFPGA. I use Ubuntu and downloaded:

## Tools

- [YosysHQ](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build/releases) for synthesis
- [RISC-V compiler](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases) for code. (I installed it manually, since I had issues with automatic download, more below.)

Then I added bin folders to my `$PATH`. I use ZSH bash so `~/.zshrc`

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/dev/fpga/oss-cad-suite-linux-x64-20211213/oss-cad-suite/bin:$PATH"                   
export PATH="$HOME/dev/fpga/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.3.0-2019.08.0-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14/bin:$PATH"    
```

## LiteX

For LiteX I followed their [official update README](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex#quick-start-guide). I had some issues to install RISC-V toolchain with `./litex_setup.py --gcc=riscv` command, you might be more lucky.

LiteX installation downloads bunch of things to the same directory where your install script is located, so create a new folder for that.

## TinyProg

For flashing TinyFPGA BX you need to install [tinyProg](https://tinyfpga.com/bx/guide.html).

# LiteX project synthesis/compilation

LiteX creates the gateware and software. You then load the binaries to the right place in the tinyFPGA SPI FLASH. I had first some issues with bad boot flash offset, but [my fix have been already merged](https://github.com/litex-hub/litex-boards/pull/308).

The most important things are in these files:

- [platforms/tinyfpga_bx.py](https://github.com/litex-hub/litex-boards/blob/master/litex_boards/platforms/tinyfpga_bx.py) where pin definitions are set
- [targets/tinyfpga_bx.py](https://github.com/litex-hub/litex-boards/blob/master/litex_boards/targets/tinyfpga_bx.py) where the complete system is described together with SPI flash.

In your LiteX root directory you run

```bash
python3 litex-boards/litex_boards/targets/tinyfpga_bx.py --build --cpu-variant=lite
```

You need to specify `--cpu-variant=lite` to fit all to the FPGA.

This command creates the memory regions, compiles very useful simple serial command line firmware and then it starts to synthetize all the gateware.

The output is in the `build/tinyfpga_bx` directory. There are two folders.

- `gateware` where the bitstream for your FPGA is generated in the `tinyfpga_bx.bin` file
- `software` where the bios serial interface firmware is compiled to `bios.bin`

## Preparing serial converter

Because TinyFPGA does not have usb to serial converter. You need to connect one with **3.3 V** levels

- UART TX pin to tinyFPGA pin 2
- UART RX pin to tinyFPGA pin 1

You can open this serial console using one of these tools

- `picocom -b 112500 /dev/ttyUSB0`
- or
- `litex_term /dev/ttyUSB2 `

With these console terminals you will see also nice colours used by the console.

## Uploading all to the FPGA

You use tinyProg

```
tinyprog -p build/tinyfpga_bx/gateware/tinyfpga_bx.bin -u build/tinyfpga_bx/software/bios/bios.bin
```

after FPGA loads the new bitsream you will see basic BIOS console

# Adding WS2812 LED peripheral

The best example how to add some hardware peripheral is WS2812 smart LED strip.

## Hardware

The WS2812 is 5V device, but if you connect just few of them to the 3V power supply, drive it with 3V signals and do not turn them all to full brightness, it will work for a test. If you power WS2812 with 5V, you might have issues since 3V data signal is too low for WS2812 to send high (logic 1) logic level. So that's why I use 3V to power them for test.

- WS2812 + connected to tinyFPGA 3.3V pin
- WS2812 - connected to tinyFPGA GND pin
- WS2812 data connected to tinyFPGA 3 pin

## Improve gateware

First import WS2812 in the begining of your python file.

```python
from litex.soc.cores.led import LedChaser, WS2812
```

I added WS2812 support right after the LED chaser effect (which is not chasing, but just blinking with the single LED on the TinyFPGA).

```python
        # Leds -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        if with_led_chaser:
            self.submodules.leds = LedChaser(
                pads         = platform.request_all("user_led"),
                sys_clk_freq = sys_clk_freq)

        self.submodules.ws2812 = WS2812(platform.request("ws2812"), nleds=4, sys_clk_freq=sys_clk_freq)
        self.bus.add_slave(name="ws2812", slave=self.ws2812.bus, region=SoCRegion(
            origin = 0x2000_0000,
            size   = 4*4,
        ))
```

This added 4 LEDs and set peripheral addres to `0x20000000`.

But we also need to edit our `platforms/tinyfpga_bx.py` file, so our gateware and mainly `platform.request("ws2812")` will know, where the LED pin is.
I added this to the platform right after `# Leds` definition.

```python
_io = [
    # Clk / Rst
    ("clk16", 0, Pins("B2"), IOStandard("LVCMOS33")),

    # Leds
    ("user_led", 0, Pins("B3"), IOStandard("LVCMOS33")),

    # ws2812
    ("ws2812", 0, Pins("B1"), IOStandard("LVCMOS33")),
```

Now if you rebuild and upload gateware and software. You might see nothing, or a nice WS2812 bitstream if you connect oscilloscope to pin 3.

![](scope.jpg)

The great thing is that BIOS allows us to read and write memory from the terminal. So we can easily test peripherals even without proper code.

To set first LED to:
- green type `mem_write 0x20000000 0x100000`
- red type `mem_write 0x20000000 0x001000`
- blue type `mem_write 0x20000000 0x000010`

The second LED has address offset of `0x04` so type `mem_write 0x20000004 0x100000` to set second LED to green.

# Demo firmware

Now I wanted custom firmware project, not just BIOS. So I looked around and there is a demo project in the `litex/litex/soc/software/demo/`.

To create a demo based on your currently generated SOC with WS2812 memory mapped type `litex_bare_metal_demo --build-path=build/tinyfpga_bx` and the demo is copied to your root project folder and compiled. Thanks to the `--build-path=build/tinyfpga_bx` the firmware will exactly know the registers and memory regions for the generated SOC.

Also check the `build/tinyfpga_bx/software/include/generated` folder, there are some useful files to understand how the memory mapping looks `regions.ld`

```c
MEMORY {
	sram : ORIGIN = 0x10000000, LENGTH = 0x00002000
	spiflash : ORIGIN = 0x80000000, LENGTH = 0x00100000
	rom : ORIGIN = 0x80050000, LENGTH = 0x00008000
	ws2812 : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 0x00000010
	csr : ORIGIN = 0xf0000000, LENGTH = 0x00010000
}
```

And in `mem.h` you can see our WS2812 peripheral and its address

```c
#ifndef WS2812_BASE
#define WS2812_BASE 0x20000000L
#define WS2812_SIZE 0x00000010
#endif
```

## Linker edits

Because tinyFPGA does not have main RAM where the code will run, we need to change `demo/linker.ld` code a bit and replace all `main_ram` with `rom`.

Now you can recompile and upload the demo firmware, it should boot

(I use this ugly command in my makefile to run make in the `demo` directory, copy it with the brackets `(` and `)`)

```sh
(cd demo && SOC_DIRECTORY='../litex/litex/soc' BUILD_DIR=../build/tinyfpga_bx make)
```

and flash demo

```sh
tinyprog -u demo/demo.bin
```

You get a similar console like in BIOS. Try `donut` renderer :)

```

donut              - Spinning Donut demo
helloc             - Hello C

```

## Adding WS2812 control

Now we add support for our new WS2812 peripheral.

Include the memory map in `main.c`

```c
#include <generated/mem.h>
```

Then replace `led_cmd` with this function:

```c
#ifdef CSR_LEDS_BASE
static void led_cmd(void)
{
	int i;
	printf("WS2812 demo...\n");

	uint32_t *ws2812 = WS2812_BASE;

	for(i=0; i<32; i++) {
		*ws2812 = 0x100000;
		busy_wait(500);
		*ws2812 = 0x001000;
		busy_wait(500);
		*ws2812 = 0x000010;
		busy_wait(500);
	}
}
#endif
```

This code might be rewritten better, I know. But it does the work.

Recompile, reload
```bash
(cd demo && SOC_DIRECTORY='../litex/litex/soc' BUILD_DIR=../build/tinyfpga_bx make)
sudo tinyprog -u demo/demo.bin
```

Now type `led` in the serial console and you get blinking WS2812 LED. Congratulations!
