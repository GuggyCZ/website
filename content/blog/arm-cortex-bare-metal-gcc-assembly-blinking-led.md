TODO - just a code. The tutorial will be written soon.

Blinking an LED

@ Register addresses from STM32F0 reference manual
.equ PERIPH_BASE,           (0x40000000)
.equ AHBPERIPH_BASE,        (PERIPH_BASE + 0x00020000)

@ Make start function global so the linker can see it later
.global _start

@ Vector table
.word               0x20001000        @ Vector #0 - Stack pointer init value (0x20000000 is RAM address and 0x1000 is 4kB size, stack grows "downwards")
.word               _start            @ Vector #1 - Reset vector - where the code begins
                                    @ Vector #3..#n - I don't use Systick and another interrupts right now
                                    @                so it is not necessary to define them and code can start here

.thumb_func                @ Force the assembler to call this function in Thumb mode, that means the least significant bit in address is set
                        @ Using this bit, the ARM core knows whether is jumping to the ARM or Thumb code, Cortex supports only Thumb
                        @ Also you can use ".type    _start, %function"

    LDR r1, =(1 << (9*2))    @ Every bin has 2 bit settings, hence *2
